# Nodeclipse is now our brand!

We got 2 'formal' email. One saying that some "Investment Group" were applying to register "nodeclipse" as their Brand Name and some "nodeclipse"  

	following Brand Name and domain names are applied by that company:
	Brand Name:
	 nodeclipse
	Domain Names:
	 nodeclipse.asia 
	 
and 10 more domain.
	 
At first we were surprised. And then after small discussion (90% chance that it is some sort of sales)
 we bought <code>nodeclipse.com<code> domain directly at our registrator.
It is not big sum of money, in the end.

This way we came to that Nodeclipse is our brand, and we somehow need to care about it.

## Site

Now as we got <code>nodeclipse.com<code> domain, we can consider some ideas for it. What is yours?
