Node.js [the most used](https://npmjs.org/) web framework is probably [Express](https://npmjs.org/package/express).
It has history of the first coming within Node.js, inspired by [Sinatra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinatra_%28software%29).
It is simple and nice. 

On the other hand, it is other framework that you have to learn. If you are developing also in Java or Ruby,
keeping in mind all those peculiarities, when you not using them everyday, is not what you should pay attention.
*Why there are not good framework, that would work in Java, Ruby and Node.js?* 

Every platform is reinventing wheel. When long enough time passed by, it can grasp the latest ideas and neglect what is fading away.
That's good. What is bad is that those framework never care to be compatible or share libraries. In fact, on the contrary
 they tend to make everything their own.
 
I invite for open discussion [here (just modify & send pull request)](https://raw.github.com/Nodeclipse/www.nodeclipse.org/master/_posts/2013-07-30-Universal-webframeworks.md),
 or add comments below. Share good framework you know, that have some features, ideas, templates shared with other languages, platforms.
 
Recently [Wikipedia articles says, that web frameworks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_framework#Features) should take care about:

- Web template system
- Caching
- Security
- Database access, mapping and configuration
- Scaffolding
- URL mapping
- Ajax 
- Web services
- Web resources

[Comparison of web application frameworks on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_application_frameworks)
has not yet Node.js frameworks, but is good example for references. 

**Are there Universal web frameworks**?
