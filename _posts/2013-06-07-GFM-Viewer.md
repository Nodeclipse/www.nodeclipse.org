I am glad to share that I have found GitHub Flavored Markdown viewer plugin for Eclipse (GMF Viewer).

It was created by [Satyagraha](https://github.com/satyagraha).

There was no update site, but sources compiled without any questions, so I have published GMF Viewer
 on [Nodeclipse site](http://www.nodeclipse.org/)  
Update site: `http://www.nodeclipse.org/updates/staging/`

I have already started using it.

We will let you know if there are some issues.

UPDATE:

I have noticed that GFM Viewer (as well as GitHub pages), doesn't show image referenced as `![GFM-Viewer.PNG](../img/GFM-Viewer.PNG)`
when used inside `_post` folder. Though Markdown HTML Preview does show.
This actually is sright, as `_post` folder content will get other path when published.
