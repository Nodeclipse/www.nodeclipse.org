[Eclipse JEE Kepler](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index-developer.php) packaging
 [has Plug-in Development Environment package](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/compare_404861.php), but not RCP.
 Does that mean that developers who get Eclipse JEE Kepler can install Nodeclipse without JSDT dependecy download (i.e. quicker)
 and they can get Nodeclipse sources and play with them (again without additional downloads)?
 
Eclipse JEE Kepler also comes with EGit and m2e (Maven Integration for Eclipse) included.

As RCP/RAP packaging also includes m2e, it is a sign of beiing on road on Maven/Tycho adoption.
