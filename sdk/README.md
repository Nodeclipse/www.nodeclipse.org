### Instructions

0. If you don't have, get latest Node.js <http://www.nodejs.org/download/>

1. If you don't have, download & install latest JDK

 <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>
 For example "Java Platform (JDK) 7u25"

2. [Download Nodeclipse SDK](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nodeclipse/files/Standard-Development-Kit/) for your operating system (currently only Windows x64).

3. Extract nodeclipse-SDK-kepler-win64-xxxx-xxxxxxxx.zip into folder where you keep our tools, e.g. D:\Progs\

4. It is recommended (and required by some projects) to use [Maven/Tycho build](http://eclipse.org/tycho/). [Download Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
 Make sure you have updated [plugins to latest version](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/AetherClassNotFound) if using Maven 3.1. (We have not yet migrated.)

4. Open `eclipse.exe` from `eclipse` folder, e.g. <code>D:\Progs\nodeclipse-SDK-kepler-win64\eclipse\eclipse.exe</code>

5. If you have error messages like

	....\jre\....
	
	That means you don't have JDK installed (JRE is not enough).
	
	Reinstall JDK (see 1.) or use [hint how to configure Eclipse](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/eclipse-node-ide/blob/master/Hints.md#select-jvm-for-eclipse-instance)

	```	
	-vm  
	C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_25\bin\javaw.exe	
	```
	
6. You default Workspace (folder where you keep you projects) is ..\ws, 
 e.g. <code>D:\Progs\nodeclipse-SDK-kepler-win64\ws</code>
 
 To change it to more suitable place, e.g. <code>D:\Workspaces\nodeclipse-SDK-kepler-win64-xxxx</code>,
 copy provided workspace <code>ws</code> as template, or follow [configuration instructions](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/eclipse-node-ide#configuration).
