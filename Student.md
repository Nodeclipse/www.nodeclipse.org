If you are beginner in fields of Software development, this article is for you.

## IDE

I guess you came here, because you already heard about Node.js,
then was looking for good tools.

Eclipse is IDE with over 10 years history, then became platform for a lot of software tools,
see [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Eclipse-based_software).

Learning a bit of Eclipse for developing Node.js will help you even if you don't plan to look at
 [Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_platform).
 
 Eclipse is [IDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment), that has `Editor`, Debugger, several `View`s 
 of the project data, that are integrated as one application.
 In Eclipse one set of UI layouts is called `Perspective`.
 
 
 ## Node.js vs Java
 
 Node.js is new, relatively simple, 4MB download size.
 
 Whereas [JDK (Java Development Kit)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDK) is currently 88MB,
  has a lot of use cases, languages. Some features are new, some are outdated.
