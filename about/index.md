<h3>About</h3>
<p>
		Since 2013 our motto has been "One-stop [work]shop for <a href="http://www.nodejs.org/">Node.JS</a> tools".
		We can't develop everything at once, but we let you know what are the best things around for
		Node.js development with <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>."<br/>
		<br/>
		Year 2014 with Maven & <a href="/projects/gradle">Gradle</a> plugins (and contribution to Markdown and other lugins on GitHub)
		shows that we should somehow to review our scope. We are surprised at what was archieved with all small steps we did put together.
		And much more is on the road. We just can't go alone. Nodeclipse is looking for supporters to share knowledge,
		and sponsors. Yes, with so many ideas we need to be able to spend more time for the project.<br/>
		<br/>
		Nodeclipse effort is driven by developers like you, who devoted some time to make and improve Node.js tooling,
		learn better Node.js, JavaScript and Eclipse. Often by chance we discovered useful plugin and practices. Now imagine if only we all shared
		our tricks to get more of our tools. Check <a href="/community">community page</a> for links we collected, add links to tutorials, article
		and useful stuff via comments or add
		<a href="https://github.com/Nodeclipse/www.nodeclipse.org/issues">an issue</a>.<br/>
		<br/>
		Nodeclipse is free open-source software released every month.
		Nodeclipse became #1 in Eclipse
